# WoltPartner-Schedule
A little help to get the Wolt shifts you want

This is a project I started while working on Wolt in Denmark (a lot of love for the Wolt support, great job guys!),
initially to try to get an edge to get the morning shifts. At the end of the day I believe it may help during
choosing the scheduled hours as the application can sometimes jamm, due to a lot of people trying to get the same shifts
at the same time.

The solution works with the WoltPartner App opened in BlueStacks 4 (so far it works so so at most). You will also need
to load the screen mapping into BlueStacks.
