# WoltPartner-Schedule
A little help to get the Wolt shifts you want.

This is a project I developed while working with Wolt as a courier to facilitate scheduling the shifs.
The code generator was created as an excersise project after finishing the JavaScript course on Ivan on Tech Academy.

<h2>PREREQUISITS</h2>

For the script to work you need to:
  1. Download and install python (tested on version 3.8.5) and modules: win32gui, pyautogui.
  2. Download and install BlueStacks 4
  3. Open and log-in to the WoltPartner App in BlueStacks. The app needs to be opened in white theme.
  4. In WoltPartner App open the menu (top left corner) and go to Scheduled hours -> Aarhus Central (or the city you are delivering in)
  5. Autoalign BlueStacks
  
  
<h2>MANUAL</h2>

  1. Download and extract the files.
  2. Open codeGenerator in a browser and choose the shift slots you want to book.
  3. Copy the code for the day you will be booking on (Thursday or Friday).
  4. Open woltPartnerBooking in a text editor.
  5. In the "pasteCodeHere()" space delete the example code and paste the code you copied from the generator.
  6. Save the file and run.
  7. After running he scrip try not to move the mouse as the program uses the cursor to interact with WoltPartner App.
  
  
  Good luck and enjoy the ride!
